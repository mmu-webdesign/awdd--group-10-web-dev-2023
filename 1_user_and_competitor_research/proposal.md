## Primary audience(s)

_A short overview of target users (reflecting your user personas and user journeys). This might include age, gender, education, occupation, income, preferred OS, browser, computer device, and internet skill level. What are the audience goals? What does the audience want and need_?

Target Users:
- Age: Regarding age, we have quite a wide target audience. Users must be 18+, as users must be of age to look after a dog.
- Gender: Our target users are of any gender, as this does not effect whether you can look after a dog.
- Education: Once again, our target users can have any form of education, most 18+ users will have atleast some form of basicv information, and this is all that is required to be able to access the site/look after a dog.
- Occupation: There is no specific target audience for occupation, the only requirement is that the users occupation does not mean they will not be around  the dog enough to care for it. For example if a user's occupation requires them to be away from home for weeks on end, they will not be fit to look after a dog, as they will need daily walks, feeding, training etc... Retirees are the most ideal users as they will have the most amount of spare time to look after their dog.
- Income: Our target users will need to have some sort of income, or have atleast previously had an income (e.g. retired or inbetween jobs). This is because looking after a dog can be quite expensive, especially when it comes to medication or any other vet bills. Also due to the fact that we will be recommending/selling dog related products, it is ideal that the users have the money to purchase the products we are advertising.

## Branding/perception

_Corporate design considerations (logo, branding, etc.), abstract qualities (friendly, professional, approachable, etc.), personality (that the site reflects or embodies), key visual attributes (colour, graphic style, etc.), language (professional, informal or instructional, etc.). How will the site deliver the desired perception_?

## Communication strategy

_What are the primary messages you want to convey to the target audience? What makes your guide unique? What can you do that other guides can&#39;t? Briefly explain how the new site will convey the primary messages_.
