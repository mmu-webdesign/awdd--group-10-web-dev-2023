# Proposal

## Project summary
Our website design will cover multiple aspects of the Dog Charity, including an adoption section, donation section, products/services section, and a general guide/advice section. The website will be a place new, existing, or even non-owners can visit to gain useful information about dog care, donate to a charity, and even browse and adopt a rescue dog. We will also advertise/recommend products related to dog care etc...

## Business objectives/goals

- Provide a space where related products can be advertised, and allow users to browse and even purchase products
- The site must be clear and easy to navigate, pages will be clearly laid out, and logically accessible
- The site must load quickly, despite the possible large amount of content
- The site must work on any device type and be adaptive to screen size
- The site must work on any browser
- The site must look professional, but also warm and eye catching
- Sensitive subject
- Features - report abuse
- Live chat


## Primary audience(s)
Target Users:
- Age: Regarding age, we have quite a wide target audience. Users must be 18+, as users must be of age to look after a dog.
- Gender: Our target users are of any gender, as this does not affect whether you can look after a dog.
- Education: Once again, our target users can have any form of education, most 18+ users will have at least some form of basic information, and this is all that is required to be able to access the site/look after a dog.
- Occupation: There is no specific target audience for occupation, the only requirement is that the user’s occupation does not mean they will not be around the dog enough to care for it. For example, if a user's occupation requires them to be away from home for weeks on end, they will not be fit to look after a dog, as they will need daily walks, feeding, training etc... Retirees are the most ideal users as they will have the most amount of spare time to look after their dog.
- Income: Our target users will need to have some sort of income, or have at least previously had an income (e.g., retired or in between jobs). This is because looking after a dog can be quite expensive, especially when it comes to medication or any other vet bills. Also due to the fact that we will be recommending/selling dog related products, it is ideal that the users have the money to purchase the products we are advertising.
- Preferred OS: The target audience for operating system includes both IOS and android users. This is because, as mentioned in our objectives above, we will be creating a website that is compatible with both OS. This ensures that we reach as large a market as possible. Making a site exclusively for one OS would severely reduce our traffic.
- Preferred Browser: Once again, as mentioned above in our objectives, our site will cater for all mainstream browsers. This ensures we reach as many users as possible. We cannot cater for all browsers that exist as there are a large number, but this should not affect our traffic as almost all users will have access to any mainstream browsers.
- Computer Device: Once again, as mentioned above in our aims/objectives, our site will cater to any Computer device. This includes mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops etc... We will ensure our site can adapt to any screen size, as to meet this aim. This also makes sure we do not limit traffic to our site, as anyone with any device will be able to access it. These accessibility features are extremely important, especially in our case. this is because we will be providing important advice and information which many users may want/need to access. We want the most people possible to be able to access our site.
- Internet Skill Level: Users will need a very basic internet skill level. As long as they have the skills to be able to access a browser, and search for a website or subject, they will be able to use/access our site. This is because all sorts of ages/education levels etc... own dogs, therefore we want to make the site as clear, efficient, and accessible as possible.

-Audience Goals:


## Branding/perception
- Our logos and branding will be consistent across the entire site; this is something we noticed was not executed well in competitors’ sites.
- The site will be both professional, but friendly. This means users will not be overwhelmed by images and content; however, the site will appear warm and human. This will also be echoed in the language used, it needs to be professional but considerate, as adoption and care can be a sensitive subject for some users.
- The site will contain a large number of images; however, these will be displayed logically and professionally, not jumbled, and cluttered.


## Communication strategy
Primary messages:
- Dog care/advice
- Charity donations
- Dog related products
- Dog adoption

What makes us unique?
Our site is unique due to it containing all the primary messages above, most similar sites only provide 1 or 2 of our primary messages, we do all of them.

How we will convey the primary messages:
We will clearly display all the messages via a clear and logical menu located across all pages of the site. This will ensure users can easily access and view all our messages, and everything we have to offer.
