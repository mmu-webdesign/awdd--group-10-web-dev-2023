### Nathan:
Profile 1:
•	Relation: Sister
•	First Name: Phillippa
•	Age: 17
•	Occupation: College Student

•	“I love animals in general especially dogs and with my dog passing away last year I’d like to be able to have another one. Having the chance to adopt one would be great and having all the advice on how to do this would be helpful as each dog behaves differently."

•	Likes: Likes the prospect of having an online guide as it makes accessing it easy (anywhere at anytime). The guide can also be spread online for others to use and raise awareness on the numbers of dogs that need adopting and the improvement of animal care that is needed.

•	Dislikes: Information can be found elsewhere. May forget about it or use another guide if it’s not to a certain standard or have all the necessary information/content.

•	Needs and goals: Informative content, easy to navigate. Different from competitors and has a useful purpose


Profile 2:
•	Relation: Nan
•	Name: Audrey
•	Age: 78
•	Occupation: Retired

•	“I want to make sure dogs are given the best quality of life and in this case a 2nd chance with owners so having a guide on how to look after them properly is perfect.”

•	Pros: An informative guide with a worthwhile purpose. May attract new dog lovers and strengthen those that already do.

•	Cons: Being online it may not be accessible by everyone so ensuring it is legible if printed or shared is important for spreading good knowledge and advice.

•	Needs and goals: Informative website/guide that gives suitable amount of advice but not too much to become over complicated or boring to read. Must be an engaging page/website.
