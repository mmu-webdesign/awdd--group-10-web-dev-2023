### Jackie Thomason
This Storyboard relates to Jackie, as due to her owning a dog it focuses more on the dog care/guide aspect of the site. This is because she is likely to use the site for this reason. 

It also focuses on the product link aspect of the site as this goes hand in ahnd with the guide. Jackie may be more likely to buy dog related products as she already owns a dog.

This storyboard also covers the general accessibility and features of the site. This is because Jackie is middle-aged, meaning her technology knowledge may be slightly more limited, therefore accessbility is key.
