### Name of persona in this storyboard
This storyboard is aimed at the elderley and disabled as it gives them the key details. It's not overcomplicated and this will be reflected in the website design. The persona related to this storyboard has a heavy interest in dogs and with her increasing age struggles to remember some key things when looking after animals in particular dogs. So this website would help with remembering thoise things. Those close to her could send the kink of the webpoage over each day if her condition deteriorated.

### Jackie Thomason
This Storyboard relates to Jackie, as due to her owning a dog it focuses more on the dog care/guide aspect of the site. This is because she is likely to use the site for this reason. 

It also focuses on the product link aspect of the site as this goes hand in ahnd with the guide. Jackie may be more likely to buy dog related products as she already owns a dog.

This storyboard also covers the general accessibility and features of the site. This is because Jackie is middle-aged, meaning her technology knowledge may be slightly more limited, therefore accessbility is key.
